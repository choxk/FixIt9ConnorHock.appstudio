/* Create ONE of the following apps, making new forms as indicated, using appStudio controls and events. Use controls other than buttons or labels, 
ones that you haven't used before. You aren't limited to Bootstrap4 controls on this exercise, but don't use Bootstrap 3 controls (again, evil).
Note: You can use a button or label if you need it -it just doesn't count in the grade.

Option A: Create a form named twoControls. In it, create an app that uses two controls you haven't used before.

Requirements:
    - The controls should be interesting and not simplistic. A label is simplistic, for example.
    - Change properties of each control from the defaults. Do something visual and note what you changed for each control in a label 
      on your form (so I don't overlook it). For example, if you make something blue, say so in the label.
    - Attach one event to each control, and write an event handler - you can just output a message using a simple popup like NSB.MsgBox().
